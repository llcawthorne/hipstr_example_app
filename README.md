This silly app is the running example from "Clojure Web Develolpment
Essentials."  It's by the book through Chapter 8, so far, but I 
haven't done the chapter 8 exercise yet to add band discography links.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
